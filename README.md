# Many_objective_paper_solutions

These solutions can be used for COMPARISON purposes only.
Each folder has 2 archives: xx_MOSOPy_zzzzzzzzzz, where xx relates to the truss experiment, y relates to the corresponding MOSOP and zzzzzzzzzzz refers to "dominated" or "non-dominated" solutions.
Note that if you have any code capable of extract non-dominated solutions from a set of points, you should obtain the non-dominated from the dominated.

If you're using any of these, please mention our paper.
